## Problem Statement

In Today’s world with so many cars, models in the market, it is hard to find out which car has a high maintenance cost/index that is authentic source. • Problem statement in Description o System that shows the health and Maintenance Index of various components of car models or car parts based on multiple factors o This will help new buyers to understand the maintenance costs of a certain model and probability of which car part requires more often servicing /change, OEM’s to understand which part is requiring frequent change and needs to be recalled and made better in the new models o Vehicle maintenance patterns across car models by mileage, usage , age of the vehicle , regional patterns across dealers, service stations and car manufacturer • Purpose and who will benefit o Consumers so they know which car has a higher maintenance and maintenance index. o Car Manufacturers , so they know which parts are getting serviced often based on the part change • How does it help the nation o Better understanding for consumers on which car to purchase with low Vehicle Maintenance Index o Govt has better understanding of car maintenance index before approving cars on the Road (ARAI Authority) • Practical and reasons why this idea could be a challenge from Implementation o Data Challenge : Build a dealer/service station network , OEM, consumers who can feed data into the system – without data this solution will not work o Ability to integrate this solution easily with the current systems which can collate the data o Marketing challenge : Owner within the Govt to take this ahead and invest this product o Political : OEM’s might not want such a system to be developed. • Domain Bucket o Transport , Vehicles.
